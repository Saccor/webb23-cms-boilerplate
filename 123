Root Configuration Files:
/src/utils/cms.js
Storyblok API Utility Functions:
getStory(slug): Fetches stories (pages or other content) from Storyblok using a provided slug.
getStaticPaths(): Generates paths for static generation using Storyblok's Links API.
generateMetaFromStory(slug): Fetches SEO metadata (title, description) for each Storyblok story. Currently, it returns placeholder metadata, but it's designed to fetch SEO fields from Storyblok stories.
Dynamic API Configuration: It switches between "published" and "draft" versions based on the environment (production or development).
/src/app/[...slug]/page.js:
Dynamically generates paths and metadata for pages based on slugs fetched from Storyblok.
Fetches page content for rendering using StoryblokCMS and maps the blocks in the currentStory to dynamically render components like Hero, Teaser, ImageWithText, and Page.
Error Handling: Returns a 404 page when the content isn't found​(page)​(page).
/src/app/not-found.js:
A simple 404 error page that renders "404 not found."
Intended to be updated to fetch and render a custom 404 page from Storyblok​(not-found).
/src/app/layout.js:
Root Layout: Defines the root layout for the entire app, using Tailwind CSS for styling and wrapping content with the StoryblokProvider for global access to Storyblok data.
Fetches global configuration from Storyblok and passes it to the Layout component to structure the site layout​(layout).
/src/app/globals.css:
Configures the project with Tailwind CSS.
Defines a custom utility .text-balance and basic CSS for the body, making the layout responsive by stretching the main content​(globals).
/src/app/robots.js:
Defines rules for the robots.txt file, disallowing the crawling of the /private/ directory​(robots).
/src/app/sitemap.js:
Generates a simple sitemap with only the root URL (/). Designed for potential expansion​(sitemap).





Component Files:
/src/components/content-types/Page.jsx:
Purpose: Renders the content of a Storyblok page. It's assumed to work with dynamic content types fetched from Storyblok.
/src/components/content-types/Hero.jsx:
Purpose: Renders the Hero block based on the content fetched from Storyblok. This is imported and rendered dynamically based on the component type in the Storyblok content blocks.
/src/components/content-types/ImageWithText.jsx:
Purpose: Renders blocks with an image and text based on the content from Storyblok. Similar to the Hero block, it is dynamically rendered based on the block's component field.
/src/components/nestable/RichText.jsx:
Likely used to render rich text content fetched from Storyblok, based on the component name and typical Storyblok usage.
/src/components/nestable/Teaser.jsx:
Renders teaser content, usually used for promotional content or previews.





Additional Files:
package.json:
Dependencies:
@storyblok/react: For interacting with the Storyblok API.
next, react, react-dom: Core dependencies for Next.js and React.
tailwindcss, autoprefixer: Used for styling the project.
Scripts: Includes standard scripts like dev, build, start, and a proxy script for SSL setup on localhost​(package).






Key Points for Adding New Components:
Define Fields in Storyblok: Create fields in Storyblok for the component (similar to how title, text, Button, etc., were defined for Hero).

Create the Component in Next.js:

Define a component like Hero.jsx that receives the blok data from Storyblok and dynamically renders the fields.
Register the Component in StoryblokProvider:

Make sure the new component is registered in StoryblokProvider under the components object.
Render the Component in Layout or Pages:

Ensure that your layout or dynamic page rendering system can handle the new component type by including it in conditional rendering logic (similar to how Hero is handled in /[...slug]/page.js).
